/**
 * REDACTED. This class will implement a UDP-based solution to exercise the entire smartsync protocol.
 * The original set reconciliation approaches (including CPIsync and Difference Digests) 
 * used TCP. Under funding from a Government R&D program through a subcontract to Cosocket
 * LLC from a prime contractor, we initiated a prototype one-to-many sync based on UDP broadcast for 
 * experimentation within that program. Due to funding cutbacks the UDP-based solution could not be 
 * developed and tested further. However since this test program was developed using program funds, 
 * until the prime contractor gets the code public-released through their organization as well as 
 * by the Government sponsor, this code remains redacted for now.
 * 
 * When I am able to develop an unencumbered alternative, I shall make it available here.
